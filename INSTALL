## pkgcacheclean
Application to clean the pacman cache on Arch Linux
https://github.com/dbermond/pkgcacheclean/

### Installation instructions

A Makefile is provided for building the application. A simple installation
procedure would be:
```
$ make
$ sudo make install
```

The provided Makefile supports the `DESTDIR` variable for staged
installations. Other common variables are also supported for the `install`
target, like `PREFIX`, `BINDIR`, and `MANDIR`. For example:
```
$ make
$ sudo make DESTDIR='./pkg' PREFIX='/usr' install
```

You can also tweak the build flags by setting the `CPPFLAGS`, `CFLAGS` and
`LDFLAGS` variables. The compiler can be choosen through the `CC` variable
and defaults to `gcc`. Compiler warnings are controled by the `WARNS`
variable and defaults to `-Wall`.

### Uninstall

Use the make `uninstall` target. It also supports the same variables of the
`install` target. For proper uninstallation, these variables must be used
with the same values used in the `install` target.
